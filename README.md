# osgDebug

osgDebug provides easy access to the various *_debug_* OpenGL extensions, allowing the code to provide additional/informative messages and annotations
that that applications like *Nsight* and *APITrace* support.

# `osgx.hpp` Extras

`osgx.hpp` is the small C++20 convenience layer that sits beside `osgDebug.hpp`; it keeps common OpenSceneGraph setup code shorter and adds a few modern range/span/lambda-friendly wrappers.

- `OSGX_DISABLE_WARNINGS` / `OSGX_ENABLE_WARNINGS` silence noisy OSG headers with compiler-specific diagnostic push/pop macros.
- `ObjectPath` is a simple dotted path accumulator used by scene-description visitors.
- `vec_t` and the `_v`, `_sz`, `_z` literals provide compact OSG scalar and size literals.
- `OSGReferenced`, `OSGArray`, and `OSGDrawElements` are concepts that constrain helpers to the expected OSG base types.
- `make_ref<T>()` and `make_nref<T>(name, ...)` create `osg::ref_ptr` objects, optionally naming the object immediately.
- `tick` and `call()` provide lightweight `osg::Timer`-based timing around arbitrary callables.
- `getFirstParent<T>()` walks an OSG parent chain and returns the first parent matching a requested type.
- `ring_buffer<T, N>` and `aring_buffer<T, N>` keep fixed-size recent samples, with the arithmetic version adding averages.
- `LambdaVisitor`, `IndexedVisitor`, `NameVisitor`, and `DescribeSceneVisitor` make common scene-graph traversal, naming, and tree-printing tasks less boilerplate-heavy.
- `VisitorEventHandler` runs a visitor against the viewer scene root when a key is released.
- `LambdaKeyHandler` binds one or more key presses to a lambda with optional access to the pressed key.
- `FilterNotifyHandler` filters known-noisy OSG notify messages with regexes before writing the rest to stderr.
- `Array<BaseArray>` wraps OSG array types with initializer/range constructors, append helpers, `std::span`, and range views; aliases include `Vec2Array`, `Vec3Array`, `Vec4Array`, and `FloatArray`.
- `DrawElements<BaseElements>` wraps indexed primitive sets with modern constructors, append helpers, primitive factories, bounds-checked pushes, spans, and views; aliases cover UByte, UShort, and UInt indices.
- `WriteTextureCallback` lets a camera draw callback write a texture to disk on demand.
- `CallbacksGroup` and its camera/node/drawable aliases fan out one OSG callback slot to multiple callbacks.
- `CameraDrawLambdaCallback` and `NodeLambdaCallback` adapt lambdas to common OSG callback types.
- The object-ID picking helpers create pick cameras, encode/decode 32-bit IDs, choose IDs from pick regions, and support sync or PBO-backed async readback.
- `PickCameraSync`, `PickHoverCallback`, and `PickHandler` wire pick cameras and readback state into viewer camera updates, hover transitions, and mouse input.
- `MultiCameraManipulator` routes input to one active manipulator while letting each target drive either the main viewer camera or its own camera, useful for RTT and multi-view tools.
- `Ortho2DManipulator` is an orthographic 2D camera manipulator with pan, geometric zoom, pixel-nudge zoom, optional Ctrl-drag 3D tilt, and automatic near/far projection setup.

# `osgDebug.hpp` Systems

`osgDebug.hpp` provides three independent systems that can be used together or separately.

---

## System 1 — GL Driver Message Callback

`glDebugMessageCallback` is the GL driver speaking *to you*. When the driver detects
an error, a performance warning, or a shader issue, it calls your registered function.
This is a completely separate pipe from the other two systems — no queries, no groups,
just the driver reporting what it observed.

- `osgDebug::initialize(gc)` — resolves all `GL_KHR_debug` extension pointers for a context.
- `osgDebug::installDefaultCallback()` — registers a callback that writes driver messages to `osg::notify`.
- `osgDebug::setCallback(fn)` / `clearCallback()` — install or remove a custom callback.
- `osgDebug::enableDebugOutput()` / `disableDebugOutput()` — toggle `GL_DEBUG_OUTPUT[_SYNCHRONOUS]`.
- `osgDebug::GraphicsOperation` — a `setRealizeOperation()` helper that calls `initialize()` once the context exists.

---

## System 2 — KHR Debug Group Annotations

`glPushDebugGroup` / `glPopDebugGroup` are *you* speaking to the GL driver — and by
extension to tools like apitrace and RenderDoc that intercept those calls. Annotations
appear as named, nested regions in a trace, making it immediately clear which draw calls
belong to which logical pass.

**Critical rule:** all calls require a current GL context. Never call `pushGroup` or
`messageInsert` from application-side C++ code (e.g. from `main()` or a viewer loop);
always use the camera callback objects, which fire while the context is guaranteed current.

- `osgDebug::DebugGroupAnnotation` — pairs `begin()` / `end()` around a named group.
- `osgDebug::Scoped` — RAII wrapper; opens the group on construction, closes on destruction. Safe inside a draw callback.
- `osgDebug::AnnotationBeginCallback` / `AnnotationEndCallback` — install a `DebugGroupAnnotation` on a camera's `PRE_DRAW` or `FINAL_DRAW` slot so it fires at the correct time.
- `osgDebug::appendCameraDrawCallback()` / `prependCameraDrawCallback()` — safely add callbacks to an existing slot without clobbering others.

Groups nest naturally. `FrameByFrameViewer` installs a `Frame { Render { } }` pair on
its camera automatically. Any other object (e.g. an `osgSlug::Atlas`) can install its
own `AnnotationBeginCallback` / `AnnotationEndCallback` and it will appear nested inside
the viewer's groups in the trace:

```
Frame
  Render
    Atlas: glyph-cache
      [draw calls]
    Atlas: labels
      [draw calls]
  /Render
/Frame
```

---

## System 3 — GPU Timestamp Profiler

`glQueryCounter` wraps each drawable in a pair of GPU timestamp queries so you can
measure actual GPU cost per draw call, averaged over a ring buffer of recent frames.
This is a two-phase design to avoid stalling the GPU pipeline mid-submission.

**Phase 1 — submit** (`ProfilerCallback`, per drawable):
```
glQueryCounter(begin) → draw → glQueryCounter(end) → push to FrameAccumulator
```
Never blocks. Install with `ProfilerVisitor` or attach `ProfilerCallback` directly.

**Phase 2 — drain** (`ProfilerFinalCallback`, per camera):
```
after all draws: read GL_QUERY_RESULT → update ring buffers → print/report
```
Blocks only on the last outstanding query. Install on the camera's `FINAL_DRAW` slot.

- `osgDebug::ProfilerCallback<N>` — drawable wrapper; issues timestamp queries and measures CPU time.
- `osgDebug::ProfilerVisitor<N>` — walks the scene graph and installs `ProfilerCallback` on every drawable.
- `osgDebug::ProfilerFinalCallback<N>` — camera callback that drains `FrameAccumulator` results.
- `QueryMode::SYNC` (default) — blocks per-query; suitable for step-by-step viewers.
- `QueryMode::ASYNC` — drains the previous frame's results with zero meaningful stall; use for continuous renderers.

## Data flow summary

```
GL driver ──glDebugMessageCallback──► your callback (errors, warnings)

you ──AnnotationBegin/EndCallback──► GL driver ──► apitrace / RenderDoc

ProfilerCallback ──► FrameAccumulator ──► ProfilerFinalCallback ──► osg::notify (or future ImGui panel)

FrameByFrameViewer::requestRender() ◄── 'n' key (or future ImGui button)
```

The three flows are independent. Annotations never need to know the profiler exists,
and the driver callback has nothing to do with either.

---

## `FrameByFrameViewer`

A single, consolidated `osgViewer::Viewer` subclass for apitrace-friendly debugging.
Press **`n`** to advance one frame; the viewer idles between keystrokes so a capture
session does not flood with unintended frames. On first render it automatically installs
`Frame` / `Render` annotation groups on the camera (System 2). Combine with
`ProfilerVisitor` + `ProfilerFinalCallback` (System 3) and `installDefaultCallback()`
(System 1) for a fully instrumented scene.
