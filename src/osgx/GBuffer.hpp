// Generic deferred G-buffer camera setup. Not PBR/glTF-specific: the proven MRT shape
// `examples/pyosg-mrt.py` validated (OpenSceneGraph.py, 2026-07-11 -- one geometry pass writing
// several SIMULTANEOUS color attachments via `layout(location = n) out`, plus a real depth
// attachment), generalized from that example's fixed two-color-buffer toon-shading demo into a
// reusable helper any deferred consumer can call -- osgx::gltf::pbribl's own G-buffer split
// (PBRIBL.hpp's PBRIBLGBuffer::create()) is built on top of this, not a separate mechanism,
// and a non-PBR deferred shader (e.g. a toon pipeline like pyosg-mrt.py's own) can use it
// directly too. Lives directly under `osgx::`, not its own namespace -- it's not a separate
// opt-in subsystem (its own #include outside the umbrella, its own CMake link target) the way
// osgx::debug/imgui/platform/gltf/ktx2 are; see TODO.md's namespace-boundary decision.

// Texture internal-format presets for one G-buffer color attachment -- matches pyosg-mrt.py's
// own validated conventions exactly: GL_RGBA for ordinary LDR color/albedo, GL_RGB16F for
// signed [-1,1] data (a view-space normal being the motivating case) so no encode/decode remap
// is needed at write or read time, GL_RGBA16F for HDR color (an emissive buffer, which can
// legitimately exceed 1.0 before tonemapping). RGBA32F is for real eye-space position data --
// see 11-sketchfab.py's own `gPosition` attachment, written straight from the vertex shader
// instead of reconstructed from depth + an inverse-projection matrix in the lighting pass; that
// reconstruction is fundamentally unreliable across nested PRE_RENDER cameras (each one clamps
// its own private near/far during its own cull pass and never writes the result back onto the
// Camera object, so a projection matrix read off a DIFFERENT camera after the fact does not
// necessarily match what actually wrote the depth buffer).
